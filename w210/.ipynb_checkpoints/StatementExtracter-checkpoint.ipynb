       " 'instead Google is trying to build a Chromebook that anyone can use and afford the pixel will go starts at six hundred and fifty dollars a full 350 less than the original pixel book',\n",
       " \"it's still a lot of money for a Chromebook\",\n",
       " \"but for the first time Google's built something better than the cheap low-end Chromebooks out there that still semi affordable unfortunately in its quest to get the price down Google\",\n",
       " 'also second rest a lot of what made the original pixel looks so intriguing in the first place but for a lot of people',\n",
       " \"those trade-offs will be worth it all of Google's previous Chromebooks as well as last year's ill-fated pixel slate tablet had distinctive designs and premium hardware with very few corners cut while the pixel book though is a nice device\",\n",
       " \"it's a phone or pedestrian computer than anything Google has released thus far\",\n",
       " \"it's a basic looking clamshell laptop with a 13.3 inch 1080p touchscreen and a black paint job unmarked except for a small Google Gee logo in the corner of the lid it also comes in very light pink with a bright coral\",\n",
       " 'underside',\n",
       " \"a much more distinctive combo but the all-black has a certain understated elegance either way the go feels sturdy and well built but doesn't have any of the distinctive design elements you'll see in the original pixel book\",\n",
       " \"it's thicker than that device still weighs about the same at 2.3 pounds\",\n",
       " 'I definitely miss the aesthetics of the original',\n",
       " \"though particularly it's glass an aluminum lid that echoed the design of goulds pixel phones the go as a functional utilitarian design which I can appreciate\",\n",
       " 'but I wish it was slightly more exciting',\n",
       " \"there is one new funky design flourish to be found the pixel book go it's ridged underside for whatever reason pictures made me think that this was a different softer material than the magnesium that makes up the rest of the goes case but it doesn't feel any different than the rest of the device google\",\n",
       " 'says it design needs word just to make the laptop easier to grip or pull out of a sleeve',\n",
       " \"but I can't have had any problems handling other computers\",\n",
       " \"still it's good to see Google's more playful side on this otherwise dull laptop and while the goal might be a little boring\",\n",
       " 'it still feels nicer and sturdier than almost any other Chromebook on the market',\n",
       " \"the otherwise excellent Asus Chromebook flip that I reviewed earlier this year it's much heavier than the go for example\",\n",
       " \"Google's surely simplified its design as a way to cut costs and as such there are some other notable changes to the go compared to its predecessor unlike the first pixel book\",\n",
       " \"it's not a convertible so tablet mode\",\n",
       " \"is out that also means it doesn't work with the pixel book pen stylus both the pixel book in the pixel slate at excellent displays with a taller aspect ratio and higher resolutions in the pixel book\",\n",

       " \"that's more than an hour longer than the 12 hour battery life google claims with mixed usage\",\n",
       " 'unfortunately I never came close to 12 hours and putting the go through my normal routine but it did last more than eight hours which is a definite improvement over the first pixel book',\n",
       " 'all this said',\n",

       " 'the go is just a straightforward no-frills device',\n",

       " 'are becoming more common now and now Google has something that can compete on quality as well as price',\n",
       " \"yes you can still get a Chromebook for less money than what Google was asked for the NGO if you think a Chromebook can be your main computer and don't mind paying a little extra for a device that's thin light and well engineered the pixel book go will likely meet your needs thanks for watching and subscribe to and gadgets YouTube channel for more news and reviews\"]"
