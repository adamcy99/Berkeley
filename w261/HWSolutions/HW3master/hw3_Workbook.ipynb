    "# HW 3 - Synonym Detection In Spark\n",

    "\n",
    "In the last homework assignment you performed Naive Bayes to classify documents as 'ham' or 'spam.' In doing so, we relied on the implicit assumption that the list of words in a document can tell us something about the nature of that document's content. We'll rely on a similar intuition this week: the idea that, if we analyze a large enough corpus of text, the list of words that appear in small window before or after a vocabulary term can tell us something about that term's meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be your first assignment working in Spark. You'll perform Synonym Detection by repurposing an algorithm commonly used in Natural Language Processing to perform document similarity analysis. In doing so you'll also become familiar with important datatypes for efficiently processing sparse vectors and a number of set similarity metrics (e.g. Cosine, Jaccard, Dice). By the end of this homework you should be able to:  \n",
    "* ... __define__ the terms `one-hot encoding`, `co-occurrance matrix`, `stripe`, `inverted index`, `postings`, and `basis vocabulary` in the context of both synonym detection and document similarity analysis.\n",
    "* ... __explain__ the reasoning behind using a word stripe to compare word meanings.\n",
    "* ... __identify__ what makes set-similarity calculations computationally challenging.\n",
    "* ... __implement__ stateless algorithms in Spark to build stripes, inverted index and compute similarity metrics.\n",
    "* ... __apply__ appropriate metrics to assess the performance of your synonym detection algorithm. \n",

    "__SOLUTION__  \n",
    "> __a)__ Spark is an open source parallel computation framework that started out as a research project at UC Berkeley designed to improve on some of the limitations of Hadoop MapReduce - particularly the facilitation of iterative and multi-stage jobs. Spark's core abstraction is the idea of the Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs), which are lazily evaluated collections of records. RDDs can include collections of Key-Value pairs (like Hadoop MapReduce) and Spark transformations comprise a wide range of 'map' and 'reduce' like higher order functions. Unlike Hadoop, Spark does not include its own distributed storage system & instead can be connected to existing resources like HDFS, Cassandra or S3 (for distributed storage) and YARN or Mesos (for cluster manager). \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ Like, Hadoop MapReduce, Spark jobs emphasize stateless programming - transformations are applied in a distributed fashion and ideally depend only on the input record(s) or RDDs. However Spark's broadcast variables and accumulators are two examples of shared variables that allow the programmer to depart from strictly stateless algorithm design.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ Spark builds a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that representes the execution plan for your driver code. The DAG represents all of the transformations & their dependencies on previous intermediate RDDs/results. When the programmer calls an action Spark will run the minimal subgraph to create the desired result. In more complex jobs analyzing the DAG can help us understand how to streamline our implementation by adding `cache()` statements and avoiding redundant shuffles.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ It is a good idea to `cache()` and RDD if that RDD will feed in to more than one subsequent action because this will allow us to avoid duplicating the same computation.\n"

    "# Question 2: Similarity Metrics\n",

Given a vocabulary $V$ (feature set) we would represent each document as a vector of `1`-s and `0`-s based on whether or not it contains each word in $V$. These \"one-hot encoded\" vector representations allow us to use math to identify similar documents. However like many NLP tasks the high-dimensionality of the feature space is a challenge... especially when we start to scale up the size and number of documents we want to compare.\n",

In this case since the vector entries are simply `1` (_if the word is present_) or `0` (_if not_)... the dot product in the numerator of the cosine distance formula is simply the count of words that are present in both documents. In the denominator, $|A||B|$, is the product of the square root of the number of unique words in each document.\n",

Intuitively, if a document with only 4 words total shares 3 of them with another that means something more significant than if the document had 50 unique words. Each of these metrics takes a slightly different approach to normalizing the count of shared words:\n",
    " * __Jaccard__: has the same numerator as cosine (number of words in common) but the denominator is instead the number of unique words between the two documents... this is the ratio of shared words to unshared words.\n",
    " * __Overlap__: again has the same numerator as cosine, but this time the denominator is the minimum of the number of unique words in each document... we could think of this ratio as the percent of words in the document with fewer unique words that are also in the other document.\n",
    " * __Dice__: instead uses 2 times the number of words in common as its numerator and normalizes by the sum of the number of unique words in each document... this is kind of like the shared word rate across both documents.\n",

This does _not_ match my intuition from reading the documents... `docA` and `docC` both seem to be about bees, whereas `docB` could be about any flying object. One reason our results might be off is because `docA` and `docB` _do_ share a lot of words -- its just that those words aren't the most important words from a meaning perspective.\n",

    "# Question 3: Synonym Detection Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Synonym Detection task we want to compare the meaning of words, not documents. For clarity, lets call the words whose meaning we want to compare `terms`. If only we had a 'meaning document' for each `term` then we could easily use the document similarity strategy from Question 2 to figure out which `terms` have similar meaning (i.e. are 'synonyms'). Of course in order for that to work we'd have to reasonably believe that the words in these 'meaning documents' really do reflect the meaning of the `term`. For a good analysis we'd also need these 'meaning documents' to be fairly long -- the one or two sentence dictionary definition of a term isn't going to provide enough signal to distinguish between thousands and thousands of `term` meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the idea of co-occurrance comes in. Just like DocSim makes the assumption that words in a document tell us about the document's meaning, we're going to assume that the set of words that 'co-occur' within a small window around our term can tell us some thing about the meaning of that `term`. Remember that we're going to make this 'co-words' list (a.k.a. 'stripe') by looking at a large body of text. This stripe is our 'meaning document' in that it reflects all the kinds of situations in which our `term` gets used in real language. So another way to phrase our assumption is: we think `terms` that get used to complete lots of the same phrases probably have related meanings. This may seem like an odd assumption but computational linguists have found that it works surprisingly well in practice. Let's look at a toy example to build your intuition for why and how.\n",

In otherwords this analysis is detecting 'word similarity' in the sense of words which have the same part of speech and function. From the limited perspective of this short corpus, `best` and `worst` are simply words that describe the 'times' while `foolishness` and `wisdom` are simply words that describe the `age`. If we had a much larger corpus I would expect that in addition to many phrases where `best` and `worst` could both work, there would also be many more phrases where only one or the other is suitable.

    "# Question 4: Pairs and Stripes at Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "As you read in the paper by Zadeh et al, the advantage of metrics like Cosine, Dice, Overlap and Jaccard is that they are dimension independent -- that is to say, if we implement them in a smart way the computational complexity of performing these computations is independent of the number of documents we want to compare (or in our case, the number of terms that are potential synonyms). One component of a 'smart implementation' involves thinking carefully both about how you define the \"basis vocabulary\" that forms your feature set (removing stopwords, etc). Another key idea is to use a data structure that facilitates distributed calculations. The DISCO implemetation further uses a sampling strategy, but that is beyond the scope of this assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this question we'll take a closer look at the computational complexity of the synonym detection approach we took in question 3 and then revist the document similarity example as a way to explore a more efficient approach to parallelizing this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4 Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ In question 3 you calculated the cosine similarity of pairs of words using the vector representation of their co-occurrences in a corpus. Imagine for now that you have unlimited memory on each of your nodes and describe a sequence of map & reduce steps that would start from a raw corpus and reproduce your strategy from Q3. Be specific. For each step be sure to note what information would be stored in memory on your nodes and what information would need to be shuffled over the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ In the asynch videos about \"Pairs and Stripes\" you were introduced to an alternative strategy. Explain two ways that using these data structures are more efficient than 1-hot encoded vectors when it comes to distributed similarity calculations [__`HINT:`__ _Consider memory constraints, amount of information being shuffled, amount of information being transfered over the network, and level of parallelization._]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) read provided code:__ The code below provides a streamined implementation of Document similarity analysis in Spark. Read through this code carefully. Once you are confident you understand how it works, answer the remaining questions. [__`TIP:`__ _to see the output of each transformation try commenting out the subsequent lines and adding an early `collect()` action_.]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ The second mapper function, `splitWords`, emits 'postings'. The list of all 'postings' for a word is also refered to as an 'inverted index'. Define each of these terms based on your reading of the provided code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) short response:__ The third mapper, `makeCompositeKeys`, loops over the inverted index to emit 'pairs' of what? Explain what information is included in the composite key created at this stage and why it makes sense to synchronize around that information in the context of performing document similarity calculations. In addition to the information included in these new keys, what other piece of information will we need to compute Jaccard or Cosine similarity?\n",
    "\n",
    "* __f) short response:__ Out of all the Spark transformations we make in this analysis, which are 'wide' transformations and which are 'narrow' transformations. Explain."

    "\n",
    "> __b)__ For a large vocabulary the analysis proposed in `a` would be infeasible because the co-ocurrance vectors & matrix could be too large to fit in memory. The stripes data structures allow us track all the same information from those vectors/matrix with less memory overhead because we don't encode all those zeros & just store the non-zero entries. Furthermore the pairs data structure allow us to compute the counts needed for the DISCO metrics (# of words in common, # of unique words, etc) without ever doing an explicit vector computation. This allows us to fine tune the level of parallelization & use local aggregation to reduce network transfer.\n",

The `reduceByKey()`s are wide transformations, they require a shuffle and we can't guarantee in advance which partitions contain the information that needs to be aggregated. We can confirm that this by looking at the DAG using the Spark UI - there are 3 phases."

As you saw in Question 3 the ability of our algorithm to detect words with similar meanings is highly dependent on our input text. Specifically, we need a large enough corpus of natural language that we can expose our algorithm to a realistic range of contexts in which in any given word might get used. Ideally, these 'contexts' would also provide enough signal to distinguish between words with similar semantic roles but different meaning. Finding such a corpus will be easier to accomplish for some words than others.\n",

When we do Synonym Detection we'll want to eliminate those words (the ones with disproportionately many neighbors) from our Vocabulary because they are not useful features to distinguish between word meanings.

    "# Question 7: Basis Vocabulary & Stripes\n",
    "\n",
    "Every word that appears in our data is a potential feature for our synonym detection analysis. However as we've discussed, some are likely to be more useful than others. In this question, you'll choose a judicious subset of these words to form our 'basis vocabulary' (i.e. feature set). Practically speaking, this means that when we build our stripes, we are only going to keep track of when a term co-occurs with one of these basis words. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ Suppose we were deciding between two different basis vocabularies: the 1000 most frequent words or the 1000 least frequent words. How would this choice impact the quality of the synonyms we are able to detect? How does this choice relate to the ideas of 'overfitting' or 'underfitting' a training set?\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ If we had a much larger dataset, computing the full ordered list of words would be extremely expensive. If we need to none-the-less get an estimate of word frequency in order to decide on a basis vocabulary (feature set), what alternative strategy could we take?\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Write a spark job that does the following:\n",
    "  * tokenizes, removes stopwords and computes a word count on the ngram data\n",
    "  * subsets the top 10,000 words (these are the terms we'll consider as potential synonyms)\n",
    "  * subsets words 9,000-9,999 (this will be our 1,000 word basis vocabulary)    \n",
    "  (to put it another way - of the top 10,000 words, the bottom 1,000 form the basis vocabulary)\n",
    "  * saves the full 10K word list and the 1K basis vocabulary to file for use in `d`.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  __NOTE:__ _to ensure consistency in results please use only the provided list of stopwords._  \n",
    "  __NOTE:__ _as always, be sure to test your code on small files as you develop it._  \n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) code:__ Write a spark job that builds co-occurrence stripes for the top 10K words in the ngram data using the basis vocabulary you developed in `part c`. This job/function, unlike others so far, should return an RDD (which we will then use in q8)."

In that sense, using the 1000 most frequent words as features would not allow us to distinguish between word meanings very well despite the richness of the raw data -- this is underfitting. Converseley the 1000 least frequent words likely only co-occur with a few neighbors, this makes them good features for discriminating between those particular neighbors but we should be suspicious that such rare words may only have co-occured by chance and that the results won't generalize -- this is overfitting.\n",
